# JavaScript OCF servers
This folder contains JavaScript implementation of various OCF servers, such as:
* Fan
* CO2 detector
* Motion Sensor
* RGB LED
* LED (on/off)
* Buzzer
* Ambient Light Sensor
* Temperature
* Button
* Switch
* Solar Panel

# Setting up the OCF servers
## Software
All the OCF servers in these folders are written in JavaScript and leverage `iotivity-node` (IoTivity JavaScript bindings) as well as the MRAA JavaScript bindings to access and control the busses (e.g. I2C, GPIO, Analog, etc.).

* Have the HW hooked up to your board (see table below)
* `node <ocf-server>.js &`
* Et voila...

## Setting up the HW devices/sensors
The connector listed below was derived from the corresponding `*.js` files. Please double-check in the code (`*.js`) in case of problems as the table may have gone out-of-sync.

| OCF server | Connector | HW device |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Fan | GPIO 9 | [Grove Mini Fan] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Mini_Fan) |
| CO2 (carbonDioxide) | A0 analog pin | [Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ2)] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Gas-SensorMQ2-p-937.html) |
| Motion Sensor | GPIO 5 | [Grove PIR Motion Sensor] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-PIR-Motion-Sensor-p-802.html) |
| RGB LED | GPIO 7 (clock) and 8 (data) | [Grove Chainable RGB LED] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/twig-chainable-rgb-led-p-850.html?cPath=156_157) |
| LED | GPIO 2 | [Grove LED Socket kit] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED) |
| Buzzer | GPIO 6 | [Grove Buzzer] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Buzzer) |
| Ambient Light Sensor (Illuminance) | A3 analog pin | [Grove Light Sensor] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Light-Sensor-p-746.html) |
| Temperature | A1 analog pin | [Grove Temperature Sensor] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Temperature-Sensor-p-774.html) |
| Button | GPIO 4 | [Grove Button] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Button) |
| button-toggle [note] | GPIO 4 | [Grove Button] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Button) |
| Switch | GPIO 4 | [Grove Switch(P)] (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Switch(P)) |

[note]: This is a variation of the classical `Button` implemenation in that it makes the button act as a toggle between `true` and `false` (instead of reporting `true` when pressed and `false` otherwise.

## Setting up the Smart Solar Panel
### Hardware components required
* 1x [Solar Panel]
* 1x [Line Actuator]
* 1x [Actuator Control Board]
* 1x [Grove LCD RGB panel]

### Setting up the Solar Panel HW components
1. Mount the [Solar Panel] and [Line Actuator] as shown in the following pictures (the [Actuator Control Board] is not visible in those pictures, refer to point 2 below for more details on how to connect all three components together):
![solar-panel-1](./.pics/solar-panel-1.png)
![solar-panel-2](./.pics/solar-panel-2.png)
![solar-panel-3](./.pics/solar-panel-3.png)
2. Connect the [Line Actuator] to the [Actuator Control Board] as follows: ![control-to-actuator] (./.pics/control-to-actuator.png)
3. Connect the [Actuator Control Board] to the [Intel® Edison Board for Arduino] using the `RC` connector as follows: ![control-to-edison] (./.pics/control-to-edison.png) and following the table below:

  | Actuator | Edison |
  |:---:|:---:|
  | **-** | `GND` |
  | **+** | `5V` |
  | **RC** | `Digital PWM pin 3` |

4. Connect the [Grove LCD RGB panel] to any `I2C` connector on the [Grove Base Shield] that is installed on your [Intel® Edison Board for Arduino] as highlighted in the green circle on the following picture. Please make sure that the `Vcc` power switch (highlighted in red on the picture below) on the [Grove Base Shield] is set to 5V to ensure proper operation of the [Grove LCD RGB panel].

### Starting the Smart Solar Panel OCF server
In order to get all components to work correctly, you will also need to make sure the following JavaScript bindings are available:

| Peripheral | Node.js module |
|:---:|:---:|
| Solar Panel | `mraa` |
| LCD | `jsupm_i2clcd` |

Not having those available will disable the corresponding device and switch to simulation mode.

Once you are all set, start the OCF server as follows: **`node solar.js &`**

Note that when using the [Ostro OS](https://ostroproject.org), its firewall will block the IoTivity network traffic by default. A brute-force approach is to disable the firewall altogether as follows:
```
# systemctl disable iptables
# systemctl disable ip6tables
```
A better solution would be to open up just the ports that are required. Port 5683 is used by the CoAP protocol during the device discovery phase, 5684 is used for secured traffic (*note:* this will be used when IoTivity turns on the `SECURED` compile-time flag) and other (random) ports are used later to communicate with the device. If you wish to open up just the required ports, you can do so as follows:
```
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5683 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5684 -j ACCEPT
```
To open ports for the IPv6 traffic, do:
```
# ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport 5683 -j ACCEPT
# ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport 5684 -j ACCEPT
```
A range of ports can also be specified as follows:
```
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport <start>:<end> -j ACCEPT
# ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport <start>:<end> -j ACCEPT
```
For more information on how to make these changes permanent in your own [Ostro OS](https://ostroproject.org) image, please follow the instructions on the [Configuring Ostro OS Firewall](https://ostroproject.org/documentation/howtos/firewall-configuration.html) page.
